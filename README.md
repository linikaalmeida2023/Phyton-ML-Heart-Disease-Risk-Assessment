**CCT College Dublin Continuous Assessment**

This project is part of the Strategic Thinking course at CCT College Dublin, aimed at evaluating and enhancing the capstone project developed in semester one. The assessment focuses on applying project management methodologies to identify strengths and weaknesses of the initial project, making improvements based on new insights, and refining machine learning results through an in-depth understanding of the dataset and model optimization.

Key objectives include:
- Evaluating and improving the capstone project with project management techniques.
- Enhancing machine learning models. In this project I applied (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) for stroke risk prediction.
- Hyper-tuning parameters and analyzing performance metrics to boost model accuracy.
- Validating results and reporting findings clearly and concisely for stakeholders.

The final deliverables include a 5-minute presentation, a detailed report, an artefact, and an individual reflective report, all demonstrating the group's collaborative efforts and project management skills.
